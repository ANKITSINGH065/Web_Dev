`npx` is a package runner tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager) starting from version 5.2.0. It allows you to execute Node.js packages without having to install them globally. The primary purpose of `npx` is to simplify the use of tools and scripts from npm packages.

Here are a few key points about `npx`:

1. **Run Local Packages:** Instead of installing a Node.js package globally, you can use `npx` to run a package directly from the local `node_modules` folder, without the need for a global installation.

2. **Execute npm Binaries:** It allows you to execute binaries from npm packages as if they were installed globally. This is useful for running tools or scripts that are part of npm packages without having to install them globally.

3. **Execute Commands:** You can use `npx` to run commands without the need to install the corresponding package. If the package is not installed locally or globally, `npx` will download and execute it temporarily.

Here's a simple example:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

In this example, `npx` is used to run the `create-react-app` tool to generate a new React application named `my-app`. The `create-react-app` package is not installed globally; it's downloaded and executed on the fly using `npx`.

Using `npx` is particularly useful when you want to run a package or tool occasionally without cluttering your global npm packages.
